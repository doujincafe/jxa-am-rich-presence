Then finally build the client by running "npm run build" or "pnpm run build"

==================
About Image Upload
==================

Image upload server code is available in src-server. Configure the server by
modifying the appsettings.json file:

- CredentialConfiguration.Username  -> the SHA-256 hash of your username
- CredentialConfiguration.Password  -> the SHA-256 hash of your password

Then you can deploy it to your hosting provider, or even locally and use tunnels
such as ngrok.

And finally you also configure the client as well:

- enableUploader to true            -> this will enable the uploader
- serverHostname                    -> the hostname of your server.
- serverUsername                    -> the username you configured at the server
- serverPassword                    -> the password you configured at the server

Then finally build the client by running "npm run build" or "pnpm run build"

For the developers, you can modify the Uploader.ts to your liking :) in case you
want to use imgur or other image hosting providers.

================
Self-compilation
================

You need Node.js and npm/pnpm

Run "npm run build" or "pnpm run build" to build. This will build both x64 and ARM executables
